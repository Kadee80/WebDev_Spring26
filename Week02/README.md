# PSA: NO CLASS this THURSDAY January 29

Your professor was hired just about a year ago by a civil engineering firm to help manage an airfield repair project at the local Air Force Base. 11 months later, the 2-day pre-construction orientation is this Wednesday and Thursday. So, class is cancelled 1/29.

## HW: Due Tuesday Week03
