# HW - Due Tuesday, Week04

1. Take a look at a fairly complicated recipe website. Using a tool of your choice, analyze/diagram what their site map and information architecture looks like. Obviously, I don’t expect you to go down to the individual recipe level, but be sure to show how the site you choose breaks down their recipes into categories and at least 1 sub-category.

2. Using the recipe you uploaded last week _(or a new one)_ wireframe your desired layout for a single recipe page on your hypothetical recipe site. Think - rows, columns, sidebars, headers, footers etc. Be sure to mark up each block of content in your wireframe with a few HTML tags for practice.

3. Mark up your recipe in [HTML semantically](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) based on your wireframe. Bonus points for applying some basic font and color styles.
